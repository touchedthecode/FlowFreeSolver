# FlowFreeSolver

FlowFreeSolver is an iOS app that solves "Flow Free" puzzles. It allows you to scan the puzzle via screenshot or camera and solves that puzzle for you. 

This project serves as my introduction to Swift and iOS Development. My primary goal is to learn the fundamental concepts of Swift, familiarize myself with iOS development practices, and become proficient with the Xcode IDE.

## Features

The core feature of the app is the ability to solve "Flow Free" puzzles. Users can scan their Puzzle via screenshot or camera, after which the app will analyze the puzzle and solve it.

## ToDos

* [x] Implement basic puzzle solving logic
* [x] Create dynamic UI for the puzzle grid
* [ ] Integrate Apple's Vision framework for scanning puzzles
* [ ] Improve the UI to better mimic the Flow Free game aesthetics
* [ ] Add error handling and edge case scenarios
* [ ] Write unit tests for key components of the app
* [ ] Optimize the puzzle-solving algorithm for better performance
